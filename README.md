# Database Transformation, Getting Insights and Solution Implementation With SQL
In the heart of an African community grappling with a water crisis, this project serves as a beacon of hope. Leveraging the power of SQL, I meticulously cleaned and explored a water survey database, delving deep into its intricacies to unearth nuggets of insight that paved the way for sustainable solutions.

Employing advanced SQL clauses such as CTE, RANK, PARTITION, SUBQUERIES, LEFT JOINS, INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, IF, ELSE and whole lot more commands, i navigated through multiple tables, weaving together data with precision. Window functions and aggregation techniques played a crucial role in drawing meaningful insights and conclusions from the datasets.

This endeavor wasn't just about numbers; it was about understanding the community's water challenges. With each query, I aimed to extract actionable insights, recommending solutions that were implemented by creating a new table in the database.

Throughout the project, the focus was on maximizing the capabilities of SQL to transform raw data into a refined and structured form, ready for analysis and solution implementation. The inclusion of advanced commands ensures an efficient and sophisticated approach to data manipulation and problem-solving.

Join me on this journey where i used SQL transform data into answers, providing a roadmap for addressing the water crisis and fostering positive change in the communities.

# Task 1
I used functions to clean, aggregate, and analyse data from the water survey database.
# Task 2
I retrieved data from multiple tables in the water survey database. 
# Task 3
I used functions, filters, and advanced SQL commands to analyse the datasets and created a table in the database that helps in implementing recommended plans.

# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
This ERD that i created helped in visualizing relationships between the tables, knowing how to join tables and also locating primary and foreign keys.
